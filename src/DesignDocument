LinearEquation Class
Instance variables
    private int x1
    private int y1
    private int x2
    private int y2
Constructor
    public LinearEquation(int x1, int y2, int x2, int x2)
Methods
public String toString() - returns original points, equation, slope, y-intercept, distance between the two points
public double findSlope() - returns slope to nearest 100th
public double findYIntercept() - returns y intercept to nearest 100th
public double findDistance() - returns distance to nearest 100th
public double findY(double x) - returns y value for given x value.

Variables
    String point1;
    String point2;
    int x1
    int y1
    int x2
    int y2
    double x3
    Scanner s
    Scanner sDouble
Steps
    Step 1: Ask for the first coordinate point,
    use scanner variable s to store it in point1,
    parse the string and store in variables x1 y1 after converting to int using Integer.parseInt().
    Step 2: Repeat step one for second coordinate point with variables point2 x2 y2 instead
    Step 3: Use the variables as arguments for the constructor.
    Step 4: Print the linear equation, slope, y-intercept,
    and distance using the methods in LinearEquation Class.
    Step 5: Ask for an x value using scanner variable sInt to find the y value and store it in x3.
    Step 6: Use a method to find the y value for the inputted x value and print both.
